# homebrew-lattice
This repository contains the Homebrew formulae for the lattice binaries, and is automatically updated by the CI system. The lattice-cli represents the current alpha version of cli, and is updated on each new tag. The lattice-cli-git represents the currents staging version of the cli, which is the built version of the cli at the head of master.

These formulas can be installed with:

` brew install mlab-lattice/lattice/lattice-cli `

` brew install mlab-lattice/lattice/lattice-cli-git `
